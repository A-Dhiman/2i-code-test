- Run the Main class from CLI
  - `mvn test`
  

- Run the Main from IDE as usual.
  - open the project as `Maven Project` in your choice of IDE, I used intelliJ
  - open `src/test/com/ad/code/Tests`
  - execute the method `testUniqueReverseList()` or class `Tests` as its annotated by junit test `@Test`
